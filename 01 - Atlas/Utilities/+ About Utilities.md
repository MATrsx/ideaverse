Think of the Utilities folder as the toolbox for your notes. 

These notes *support* your other notes.

- `Images` automatically get added to "Images" folder (and any other attachments you bring into your vault).
- `Templates` will be stored in a "Templates" folder as well.

You may also want to keep specialty files here like:

- `Canvas` files (which are .json files)
- `Excalidraw` files (which are remarkably still regular markdown .md files)
