Imagine having 1,000 of your favorite ideas all in one place. Your favorite concepts, quotes, and memories finally all connected in one living, powerful system.

Think of this as your **Ideaverse**—and it's what you will create during the workshop.

In the "Linking Your Thinking" (LYT) Workshop you will create your custom—and future-proof—PKM system. PKM stands for Personal Knowledge Management. 

The LYT Workshop is an online workshop that will teach, train, and support you in building a PKM system you can trust.

You will learn a proven method to:

- Do your best thinking, more often
- Reliably organize your knowledge
- Unlock your unique perspective
- Generate more insights

And as a side benefit you will:

- Rediscover the joy of thinking.

The workshop is also a community-driven learning experience. Learning with your fellow students is the best way to accelerate your own efforts. 

Linking Your Thinking is all about making a change in your relationship with knowledge.

Build the place for your thoughts that you've always wanted.
