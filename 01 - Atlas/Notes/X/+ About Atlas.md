An Atlas is a "map of maps". 

The Atlas folder contains your map notes (MOCs), ideas, assets, and other bits of knowledge.

You'll usually navigate to them using your [[Home]] note, but keeping them in a folder away from your ever-growing note collection allows you to maintain them more easily as well as quickly navigate between them using the sidebar. 

These notes are so important, they truly deserve their own folder.
