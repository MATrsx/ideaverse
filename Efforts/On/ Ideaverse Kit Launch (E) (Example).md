The Ideaverse for Obsidian can be both efficient and evocative. 

Without being present, I want to give as much useable value as possible.

# Things I've Shared Ahead of Time

> [!NOTE]+ From Friday, 2023-08-18 Newsletter
> # ðŸŒŒ Ideaverse for Obsidian launches soon!
> 
> **Ideaverse for Obsidian** launches on Product Hunt on Wed, Aug 30th. You can help by [creating a Product Hunt account](https://www.producthunt.com) ahead of time to support the launch. Here are some things to expect:
> 
> - A working Home Dashboard that combines Knowledge & Action
> - The official release of the ACE Folder Framework
> 
> In [last week's newsletter](https://ckarchive.com/b/92uzhnhqznmq0t9h0200933), I hinted at why ACE is awesome:
> 
> - Manage everything with ACE: Atlas, Calendar, and Efforts
> - Use ACE to remember more
> - Allow ACE to flex with your life
> - Manage your efforts with ACE
> 
> Here's more secret sauce behind the ACE Folder Framework...
> 
> â€‹
> 
> ## ACE gives you 3 Spaces for the 3 Head Spaces of PKM
> 
> In PKM, there are three main Head Spaces to move between.
> 
> - Knowledge-based (The Atlas folder)
> - Time-based (The Calendar folder)
> - Action-based (The Efforts folder)
> 
> You may find yourself completely immersed in a single headspace (a single folder), while completely neglecting the other two. You may even start to question if you need the other two folders.
> 
> Donâ€™t worry, _**life is long and the pendulum will swing.**_
> 
> - You may be spending time in **Efforts** when...you find a new interest and wonder how to manage all the knowledge coming in.  
>     â€‹  
>     So it's time to shift to the **Atlas**.  
>     â€‹
> - You may be spending time in **Atlas** when...you start a new job and have to rapidly take a bunch of daily notes to make sense of later.  
>     â€‹  
>     So it's time to shift to **Calendar**.  
>     â€‹
> - You may be spending time in **Calendar** when...you have a good sense of your commitments in your new job and are ready to start managing things.  
>     â€‹  
>     So it's time to shift back to **Efforts**.
> 
> See how this is working?
> 
> ACE acknowledges and supports the 3 Head Spaces of PKM.

> 
> ## ACE helps you with Context-Switching
> 
> It's hard to switch contexts. It's also hard to know when you should. ACE helps with that.
> 
> When Iâ€™m frolicking in the forest of new information, it's my own enthusiasm that propels my learning.
> 
> Question: Where do you think I am spending my time then?  
> â€‹Answer: In the **Atlas**â€”where I'm note-making and sensemaking on things that may not be urgent, but still feel important.
> 
> However, there are long stretches of time where my frolic becomes a more of a march. I need to make progress on things that have a clear direction with tangible outcomes.
> 
> Question: Where do you think I spend my time then?  
> â€‹Answer: In **Efforts**â€”where I'm executing on things that are important and urgent.
> 
> And there are times where Iâ€™m quickly taking meeting notes, or logging things I care about, or planning the month and I find myself spending time in daily, weekly, and monthly notes; freewriting, compiling, planning, and consolidating.
> 
> Question: Where do you think I spend my time then?  
> â€‹Answer: In **Calendar**â€”where I'm working with Past Me, Present Me, & Future Me.
> 
> â€‹
> 
> These context switches can happen in the moment, hourly, daily, weekly, and so on.
> 
> ACE honors Knowledge, Time, and Action equallyâ€”and naturally nudges you to remember to give any neglected Headspace some attention.

> I had a rather big breakthrough with the core system of knowledge management that I teach. It has to do with my quest for a universal folder system that works for me, other sensemakers, for links, for my Finder, and for teams. I believe ACCESS has achieved it's final form...

> 
> I shared these thoughts where I first started sharing a lot on the internet, within the Discord/Discourse communities of Obsidian. It feels so freeing to have a place to share these things.
