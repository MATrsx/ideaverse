> I've redacted about half of the random ideas I've logged here from June 2022 to July 2023. I hope this help you see how low-tech an idea log can be. And yet, you can see how I've naturally linked out to so many different URLs and notes.

	- [[Idea - Flywheel visual]] Do you even know what a flywheel is? Showing that youtube vid with the guy with the bicycle with the flywheel motorizing mechanism. I've found that's the best way to convey the concept

	- idea combining [My Dinner with Andre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBpSgAF_Mws) with ChatAI

	- *Root for clusters, not clubs*. How the B1G bowl game revenue is [split equally](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/989oq3/why_do_bowl_game_payouts_get_split_between/), meaning the team that earned the spot, gets less than 10% of the revenue. Lead with the USWNT and the USMNT equal pay issues. Pull in which [states get the most from the federal government](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/these-states-get-the-most-money-from-the-federal-government/ar-AARqw6u). Not sure the takeaway. It's easy to make "not fair" headlines, but the truth is more nuanced and fascinating. It should change the level of emergence at which you root (even if begrudgingly). That means root for men's *and* women's soccer. For Nebraska *and* Wisconsin. For Montana *and* California. It reminds me of what Coach Hauke said at the U of Montana high school football camp in 2002: "Up with Montana." A message of solidarity. Perhaps it can go back to the empowering frame of mind that [[a rising tide raises all boats]].

	- I just played with changing ACCESS to ACE. I'd love to make a silly video using the way-too-epic Staples logo reveal video. Use that video. Just burn in a Keynote animation in the big TV's. Maybe a few words of voiceover introducing "ACE."

	- this way, they can't leverage the time and energy they put into trying to understand a new concept. More dangerous, they never connect the dots to see the connections between the different courses they have to take.

	- **Kepano** aka Stephan Ango has some really insightful note titles: "Evergreen notes turn ideas into objects that you can manipulate"
	- [[Idea Emergence]]: What was said in LYT W9 1b.6 lesson comment by [Nicholas Seitz](https://community.linkingyourthinking.com/u/a81c1c05?).
		- Idea emergence is the process of moving from isolated notes to collections of notes with the accrued personal value of your own thought. Because organizing and linking notes is a tangible representation of your own processes of thinking, the creation of higher-level notes which string together multiple disparate ideas is both a record of your thinking and a means of navigating notes quickly based on topical connections already established in your own mind. This "offloads" the work of thinking from your gray matter to a tangible thing which is a record of the work you've already done and thus is future value in all knowledge-based work.
	- Colin Robinson the actor's career...If you wanted to be an actor on The Office, what would you do? Probably not pretend you were a yo-yo enthusiast speaking to kids about the environment so you could get on local news stations, but that's what HE did.
	- I'm very happy with STIR. It has legs regardless of the situation or tool, which is why I like it so much.
	- Knowledging, knowledgment, and knowledger would be nice if they were actual words that were easy to say and type. They are not, so sadly, I don't think I care to stand on that hill.

	- Compare the Japanese "garden master" to the PKMer. The Japanese garden designers are sometimes called _niwa shi,_ "garden masters."

	- Your Knowledge Network in an Iceberg. People only see 10% of it, but it's the work no one sees that leads to work no one ignores.
	- I learned much of my writing from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.

	- When talking about idea emergence, you can combining "remix provenance" with James Burkian path splits (CYOA) Now from here we could go into BLANK or we could go into BLANK (but try to have either one be able to be an open loop to close at the end).

	- [[Creativity is not about the narrowing options, it's about the emergence of ideas]] (through the lens of your unique perspective)
	- I take major umbrage to the myopic Diverge-Converge graphic and way of thinking. The truth is closer to Emergence: the combination of elements to created greater—or at least distinct—from the sum of its parts.
	- Do you think Bob Ross painted by some sort of Divergence-Convergence BS? No, Bob wasn't narrowing his options, he was exploring them as he drew, and then his best work would emerge!

	- Everything is NOT a remix...[[The art form around how art forms]]
	- I take major umbrage to the myopic idea that "everything is a remix". This relates to the Kate Bush & Stranger Things idea...and beethoven and hamilton (is Hamilton a Remix? how insulting, but it does take inspiration from existing sources and exquisitely pays tribute through a process called Homage.)

- 2022-06-20 - The [[Sauna is a Faraday Cage for Super Thinking]]
	- What I like about the sauna, it cuts off the ability to be on electronics. 
- 2022-06-19 - Shade trees for ourselves (or blacktop)
	- On how value is created...Roman's planting shade trees equals strong society...well, what if we think of our day as a full life. So each each is a full life. Are we planting trees for our Future Self? For the Following Generations of Our Life? This metric for a strong society is the same metric for a strong person. And the reverse is true. Project-obsessed people who lost the joy of thinking will build skyscrapers and urban jungles in their minds, highly efficient but highly overcooked with urban black tops causing heat exhaustion and making life less joyful. %% Could be youtube video %%
