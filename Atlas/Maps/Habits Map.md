## Understanding Habits
- [[Defining a habit]]
- [[Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage]]
- [[Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia]]
- [[The neural formation of habits is additive]]
	- [[The truest habit metaphors are additive]]
	- [[Ant pheromone trails act like potential habits]]

## Designing Habits

[[Important habits preserve mental clarity and a sense of control]]
[[Preparing for the next day is an important habit]]

## LYT Vision
Activate "LYT Vision" to resurface thoughts in context. When you twirl this open, it's like you are putting on night vision goggles: you see things hidden in the shadows.

The main contextual queries I prefer are "unrequited" & "unmentioned" notes. 

### Unrequited notes
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [[Habits MOC]]
and !outgoing([[Habits MOC]])
sort file.mtime desc
```

### Unmentioned notes, with related tag
These notes have the tag `#` and are not mentioned above.

```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from #on/habit 
and !outgoing([[Habits MOC]])
sort file.mtime desc
```
