Being trapped searching endlessly for salvation

### Web
"Sinner Man" or "Sinnerman" is an African American traditional spiritual song that has been recorded by a number of performers and has been incorporated in many other media and arts. The lyrics describe a sinner attempting to hide from divine justice on Judgment Day.

[[Nina Simone (kit)]] recorded her definitive 10-minute-plus version on her 1965 album Pastel Blues, on which the credit is simply given as "Arranged by Nina Simone" .

The earliest recording of the song to bear the title "Sinner Man" was by the Les Baxter Orchestra in 1956.
