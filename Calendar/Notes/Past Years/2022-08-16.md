Well, the final episode of Better Call Saul aired yesterday. I'm so proud to have worked on it. It was—top to bottom—the kindest and most talented group of people I've worked with. I'm eternally grateful for the experience. And damn, what a tour de force of a show! It puts so many other shows to shame.
