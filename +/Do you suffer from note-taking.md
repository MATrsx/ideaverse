# Do you suffer from note-taking?

I don't have much time...
If you are receiving this video, you may be wondering if you, your colleague, or your loved one has gone mad because of all the notes they are taking.

It's a common concern, especially when society rewards more toxic forms of productivity. Here's what you need to know:

There are three core reasons to have notes: *To learn things, to remember things, and to create things.* %% Need an FCP Venn Diagram and thick lines and thick text. %%

That tracks with the polling I've done with thousands of people: Two thirds of us are here to learn and remember things. The other third of us are here create things. %% Need the FCP Venn to animate so two circles become a single bigger circle on the left with the text "Learning & Remembering" while the smaller circle on the right staying "Creating" %%

And here's the interesting part: when you get good at learning and remembering, you can't help but want to start creating. %% Add an left-to-right curvey arrow on top %%

And once you get good at creating, can't help but want to start learning and remembering new things. %% Add an right-to-left curvey arrow on bottom %%

## Examples
Relatable Example

- When was the first time you heard the word "notes" into was probably with "notebook" (Show a notebook). You were told to take notes. Forced to, really. Not fun. Forget that. Replace it with something YOU care about. When you take notes on things you find interesting, the game changes. You feel empowered because you can more powerfully, wait for it...learn, remember, and create.

Famous Examples

- Eminem made notes. He called it Stacking Ammo. It is a core part of his creative process. Without his notes, Eminem would have remained Marshall Mathers. Are you gonna tell Eminem to stop making notes? I didn't think so.
- Are you going to admonish Plato and Aristotle for writing down their thoughts? Maybe we should be saying thanks instead.

Rebellion

- Taking notes, journaling, and making notes: it's an act of rebellion in the modern world. When the world says "if you didn't ship, it doesn't count" the note-maker remembers who wins the race between the tortoise and the hare. And the last time I read that story, the ending didn't change. All that glitters isn't gold, and moving slow beats moving fast, when moving fast means moving in circles.

So now please share this video with a colleague or loved one who is worried about you. Let's not admonish those of us who make notes. Let's thank them for thinking.

You there. Yeah you. I see you, making notes. Thank you for caring. Thank you for thinking. Thank you for making the most of your mind.

You haven't gone mad. You just want to stay more connected to your internal compass, your inner voice, your most meaningful self.

## Outro
If anyone needs more convincing, in this video I answer "Why make notes" and it's way more than most people think. I hope to see you there.
