Keep tabs on your personal finances. 
Fuzzy areas like [[ My Health (OE) (Example)]] and [[ My Finance (OE) (Example)]] are both maps and efforts.
Here are some areas to consider...

- In
	- [[My Investments]]
- Out
	- [[My Insurance]]
	- [[My Housing]]
	- [[My Medical]]
	- [[My Auto]]
	- [[My Bills]]
- Big Out
	- [[ My Taxes 2023 (OE) (Example)]]
- Accounts
	- [[My Accounts]]

> [!NOTE]+ Notes on this note
> This is a sanitized version of my actual note. 
> - Almost all content and links have been removed.
> - Nick, go here [[My Finances ðŸ’° (non-kit)]]

Many of these areas (like managing taxes) work well in basic computer folders, PDFs, and spreadsheets. You can link from here to there. Then these notes become your hubs and launchpads. 

It's fine to leave some documents or projects within apps that are better-suited to handle them. But *notes* about these documents or projects can help you further reflect, ideate, or push goals forward. 

You might even find an excellent balance between managing projects and efforts outside of your core PKM tool, while spending time examining them in this space for a more mindful perspective.
