> # PKM has officially arrived at UCLA
> 
> Yesterday was the official start to ushering in PKM and linked thinking at UCLA!
> 
> We have a group working on everything from plays, short films, essays, sitcoms, books, articles, and pitch decks.
>

> 
> The UCLA class is a much more intimate group than the Linking Your Thinking Workshop. But I deeply enjoy both for different reasons.
> 
> Personally, I'm thrilled that the frameworks I've taught and refined over 14 LYT Workshops made an impact for writers who are _**brand new**_ to PKM.
> 
> It's become this simple...
> 
> I just introduce three frameworks to empower us:
> 
> - **Gardeners and Architects**: how we approach problems
> - **Idea Emergence** (notes, maps, home): how our ideas grow
> - **ARC** (add, relate, communicate): how we get stuck
> 
> This leads to a cascade of self-understanding. "Oh, that's how I work; I'm a **gardener**...but my partner is an **architect**...I can actually understand her so much better now!"
> 
> I explained **Idea Emergence**, I concluded by saying, "But in the end, there are just three levels (notes, maps, home). When you get stuck gardening, go back to the map. When you get stuck architecting, you have to get back into the weeds."
> 
> And the **ARC** framework unifies everything!
> 
> Not only does it show Idea Emergence, it let's anyone see where they are getting stuck with the flow of their ideas, and immediately how to get unstuck.

> 
> The result?
> 
> In just a few minutes, this **_high-level theory becomes immediately practical._**
> 
> I feel that this group at UCLA has the potential to truly supercharge their writing efforts (the promise of the course), and I want to applaud their willingness to throw themselves into the fire with learning **_just enough_** of that wacky Obsidian app.
> 
> As if writing wasn’t hard enough!
